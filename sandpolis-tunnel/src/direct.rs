//! The direct (hole-punched) tunnel seam.
//!
//! A `Direct` tunnel between a client and an agent would establish a
//! peer-to-peer connection with UDP hole punching and run the data stream over
//! it, bypassing the server entirely. None of that transport exists yet — there
//! is no UDP transport, no DTLS `InstanceConnection`, and no STUN/TURN-style
//! rendezvous — so [`attempt_direct`] always fails and the caller falls back to
//! the indirect server bridge.
//!
//! When hole punching is implemented, `attempt_direct` returns a live
//! `InstanceConnection` over a DTLS transport (the third transport the
//! `InstanceConnection` doc comment anticipates), the rendezvous below is
//! exchanged through the server to synchronize the punch, and the tunnel's data
//! stream runs over the returned connection instead of the bridge.
