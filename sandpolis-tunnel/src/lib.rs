//! Application-level tunnels: forward TCP/UDP traffic between any two instances
//! (except two clients).
//!
//! A tunnel is declared in a realm config with SSH-style local/reverse
//! semantics: one endpoint — the *listener* — binds a socket, and every
//! connection it accepts is carried to the other endpoint — the *terminator* —
//! which dials the real target and copies bytes back and forth.
//!
//! ## Indirect (default)
//!
//! The global stratum server reads the config and bridges the tunnel: it opens
//! a [`streams::TunnelStream`] toward each endpoint and copies bytes between
//! them, keyed by a logical connection id. This always works — it rides the
//! same multi-stratum relay every other stream uses, so an endpoint behind a
//! local stratum server is reached transparently.
//!
//! ## Direct (client <-> agent, best effort)
//!
//! A `Direct` tunnel would hole-punch a peer-to-peer connection and run the
//! data stream over it, bypassing the server. That transport does not exist
//! yet, so [`direct::attempt_direct`] always fails and the tunnel falls back to
//! the indirect bridge seamlessly; the observed choice is recorded as
//! `effective_mode`.
