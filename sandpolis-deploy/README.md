## `sandpolis-deploy`

Enables custom agents called "deployers" to be built and deployed. Deployers
install themselves on first execution. If an agent is already installed, the
deployer overwrites the existing instance.

Realm certificates and configuration are embedded into the application for a
seamless install.
