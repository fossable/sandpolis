//! Reachability advertisements: how a server learns to route to instances that
//! aren't connected to it directly.
//!
//! A local stratum (LS) server tells its global stratum (GS) server which
//! instances are attached to it. The GS records those in its [`Relay`] so a
//! client attached to the GS can open a stream to an agent behind the LS without
//! knowing anything about the topology — it addresses the agent by `InstanceId`
//! and the servers work out the path.
//!
//! The reverse direction needs no protocol: an LS forwards anything it can't
//! resolve to its GS by default route (see [`Relay::set_upstream`]).
//!
//! Only server peers may advertise. The GS registers the responder exclusively
//! on connections whose peer is a server, so an agent or client cannot claim to
//! carry traffic for someone else.
//!
//! [`Relay`]: super::stream::Relay
//! [`Relay::set_upstream`]: super::stream::Relay::set_upstream
