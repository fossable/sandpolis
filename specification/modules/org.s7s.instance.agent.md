# Agent Instance

At a general level, agents are responsible for carrying out tasks for remote
users. They can connect over the network to any other type of instance. At
minimum, agents must be associated with one server.

## Instance Configuration

```py
# com.sandpolis.agent
{
  "network" : {
    "servers"          : [
      String(), # A server hostname and port
    ],
    "timeout"          : Number(default=1000),  # The server connection timeout in milliseconds
    "cooldown"         : Number(default=1000),  # How long to wait after each connection
    "strict_certs"     : Boolean(default=True), # The agent will refuse to connect to a server that presents an invalid certificate
    "polling_interval" : Number(default=0),     # The connection poll interval in seconds
  },
  "auth" : {
    "password"    : String(),
    "certificate" : String(),
  },
  "collectors": [
  	String()
  ]
}
```

## Connection Modes

There are two connection modes that have an impact on performance and latency.

### Continuous

In continuous mode, the agent maintains its primary connection at all times. If
the connection is lost, the agent will periodically attempt to reestablish the
connection using the same parameters it used to establish the initial
connection.

The connection mode can be changed on-the-fly by a user or scheduled to change
automatically according to the time and day.

### Polling

In polling mode, the agent intentionally closes the primary connection unless
there exists an active stream. On a configurable schedule, the agent reconnects
to a server, flushes any cached data, and checks for any new work items. After
executing all available work items, the primary connection is closed again.

The agent may attempt a spontaneous connection outside of the regular schedule
if an internal agent process triggers it.

## Plugins

Agents can optionally support plugins to enhance functionality beyond the
standard feature set. Upon initial connection, the agent provides a list of
plugin versions that it has loaded. The server responds with a list of plugin
archives that the agent should install.

## Standard Feature Set

The standard feature set is the minimum amount of functionality an agent
implementation must provide.

### AgentMetadata

## Upgrades

There are two ways to upgrade the agent:

- automatically by sending the update command to the server,
- manually by generating a new installer and executing it on the agent

### Manual Upgrade

A manual upgrade is triggered when an installer is executed on the agent and the
relevant base directory is already populated with an installation. If the agent
is not running, the installer will overwrite the base directory and install
itself. Any data that the agent has cached but not sent to the server will be
lost!

Advantages

- This is the only way to upgrade if the agent can no longer connect to the
  server

Disadvantages

- Manual intervention required
- Cached data may be lost

### Automated Upgrade

If the agent is connected to a server, it can be upgraded remotely. This will
cause the server to fetch the agent configuration, generate a new installer, and
transfer it to the agent. The agent then executes the new installer and
terminates.

### Container Resident

## Boot Agent

Several boot agent operations are accessible from typical agents.

### Installation

Typical agent instances are capable of installing a boot agent on their host
machine if installed with sufficient permissions. Write access to the `EFI`
directory on the ESP partition is required for installation and uninstallation.

The boot agent artifact is a standard `.efi` file generated by a server
instance. The agent simply copies the file to the ESP partition.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall, an agent must simply delete the boot agent from the ESP partition.

### Reboot into boot agent

Agents can launch the boot agent indirectly by setting the `BootNext` variable
to the index of the boot agent's EFI entry and rebooting the machine.


## Installation Types

There are three ways to install the agent, each with advantages and
disadvantages.

### Package Manager Installation

This option makes installation itself easy, but requires some effort to
configure the agent to connect to a server. This installation type also means
that upgrades must only occur through the package manager.

#### Filesystem Layout

##### Pacman (Arch Linux)

| Path                                              | Description                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `/usr/lib/systemd/system/sandpolis-agent.service` | Systemd service definition |
| `/usr/bin/sandpolis-agent-config`                 | Configuration executable   |
| `/usr/bin/sandpolis-agent`                        | Main executable            |
| `/usr/share/java/sandpolis-agent/lib`             | `LIB` location             |
| `/usr/share/java/sandpolis-agent/plugin`          | `PLUGIN` location          |
| `/var/lib/sandpolis-agent/data`                   | `DATA` location            |

##### Apk (Alpine)

### Deployer Installation

This option requires no explicit configuration, but the _deployer_ executable
must be transferred to the host and invoked explicitly.

#### Filesystem Layout

Deployers install everything under a single _base directory_ and create symbolic
links in certain locations outside of the base directory.

| Platform | Default base directory path |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| Linux    | `/opt/sandpolis-agent`      |
| Windows  |                             |
| macOS    |                             |

### Docker Installation

This option is easy to deploy and configure, but can limit the functionality of
the agent in some cases.

Certain elements of the host filesystem may be optionally mounted into the
container.

## Probe Mode

Probes are similar to agents, but are only allowed to egress data to a server.
They cannot receive messages, so their configuration is immutable unless the
system also runs an agent capable of managing probe instances.

This design is a security feature which ensures probe instances cannot be compromised
even when the gateway server is compromised.

The only connection mode supported by probes is the _polling_ mode. On a
configurable schedule, the probe reconnects to a server, flushes any cached
data, and closes the connection.

The probe may attempt a spontaneous connection outside of the regular schedule
at any time.
