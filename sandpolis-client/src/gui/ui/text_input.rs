//! Themed wrapper around Bevy's native [`EditableText`] widget.
//!
//! This is intentionally thin: it only applies the app [`Theme`] (border,
//! background, font, cursor colors) to a native [`EditableText`] node. Cursor
//! movement, text selection, IME, and clipboard paste are all handled upstream by
//! `bevy_ui_widgets::EditableTextInputPlugin` (installed via `UiWidgetsPlugins`).
//!
//! Features the native widget doesn't yet provide (placeholder text, password
//! masking, submit events) are deliberately omitted — we'll adopt them from
//! upstream when they land rather than maintaining our own versions.
//!
//! Read the current contents by querying [`EditableText`] and calling
//! [`EditableText::value`]; the currently focused entity is in [`InputFocus`].
//! Because focus targets the editor entity directly (and `FocusedInput` bubbles
//! *up*), attach the caller's marker component to the same entity as the editor,
//! e.g. `parent.spawn((MyInput, text_input(theme)))`.
