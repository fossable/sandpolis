//! Node panel host.
//!
//! Every visible node in the world view carries one panel, anchored beneath it.
//! The panel is *collapsed* by default — the node's identity plus whatever
//! summary the active layer wants, at a depth that follows the camera's zoom —
//! and *expands* in place to the layer's full detail view when its node is the
//! only selected node, or while it is pinned.
//!
//! This module owns the chrome (anchoring, the identity line, the pin and close
//! buttons, the mobile sheet) and defers the body to the active layer's
//! [`NodePanel`]. Panels are keyed on [`NodeHitbox`], the same component
//! selection and dragging key on, so instance nodes, probe device nodes and
//! account nodes are all covered by one host rather than three.
