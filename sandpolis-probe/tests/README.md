# Probe test container

A throwaway fixture that brings up one server per protocol the probe layer
speaks, so every probe can be exercised against a real implementation. It is not
wired into `cargo test` — build and run it yourself.

Everything is built from the repo's pinned nixpkgs via `packages.nix`, so the
daemons track the rest of the tree. The image is large (Samba, ffmpeg, and
OpenIPMI all come along), so the first build pulls a lot from the binary cache.

## Build and run

The build context is the repository root (the image needs `nix/nixpkgs.nix`):

```shell
docker build -f sandpolis-probe/tests/Dockerfile -t sandpolis/test-probe .
docker run --rm --network host sandpolis/test-probe
```

Host networking is the easy path: the portmapper hands out ports of its own and
RTSP can fall back to UDP, neither of which survives a hand-written publish list.
To keep the container isolated instead, publish the ports explicitly:

```shell
docker run --rm \
  -p 22:22 -p 80:80 -p 111:111 -p 111:111/udp -p 161:161/udp -p 445:445 \
  -p 554:554 -p 623:623/udp -p 2049:2049 -p 2050:2050 -p 3389:3389 \
  -p 3493:3493 -p 5900:5900 sandpolis/test-probe
```

### Rootless Docker and Podman

Binding a port below 1024 needs `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, which a rootless
container doesn't have while it shares the host's network namespace: with
`--network host` every daemon on a standard port — SSH, HTTP, SMB, RTSP, SNMP,
IPMI, and the portmapper — fails to bind. The entrypoint checks for this at
startup and moves those daemons out of the way rather than serving nothing:

| Standard | Moved to | Standard | Moved to |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 22       | 2222     | 554      | 8554     |
| 80       | 8080     | 623      | 1623     |
| 445      | 4445     | 161      | 1161     |

It says so in the log, and the listening-port summary it prints at the end has
the final word. The portmapper is pinned to 111 by the RPC protocol, so it has
nowhere to move: it stays off, and NFS is served without it (the probe's
GETPORT path can't be exercised in that mode, but its pinned ports still work).

Publishing ports instead keeps the standard numbers, because the container then
gets a network namespace of its own — only the host side of each mapping has to
be unprivileged (`-p 2222:22`).

## What it serves

| Port | Protocol | Daemon | Probe |
|--------------|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| 5900 | VNC | TigerVNC `Xvnc` | `vnc.rs` (desktop) |
| 3389 | RDP | `freerdp-shadow-cli` | `rdp.rs` (desktop) |
| 2049, 2050 | NFSv3 | `unfsd` (mount on 2050) | `nfs.rs` |
| 111 | portmapper | `rpcbind` | NFS port resolution |
| 445 | SMB2/3 | Samba `smbd` | `smb.rs` |
| 554 | RTSP | `mediamtx` + `ffmpeg` | `rtsp/` |
| 3493 | NUT | `upsd` + `dummy-ups` | `ups.rs` |
| 22 | SSH | OpenSSH `sshd` | `ssh.rs` (shell) |
| 80 | HTTP | `lighttpd` | `http.rs` |
| 161/udp | SNMP v1/v2c | `snmpd` | `snmp.rs` |
| 623/udp | IPMI | OpenIPMI `ipmi_sim` | `ipmi.rs` |

`Xvnc` is both the X server for `:0` and its VNC server, and
`freerdp-shadow-cli` mirrors that same display — so VNC and RDP show the same
desktop, and an RDP-only run still listens on 5900. That display is a virtual
framebuffer inside the container, never a host screen: it runs an Openbox
session with a terminal ticking a UTC clock, so a capture is visibly live. RDP
negotiates TLS security (not NLA/CredSSP) with a self-signed certificate, which
matches the RDP probe's first-cut behavior.

A syslog sink relays every daemon's log messages to the container's stdout: a
container has no `/dev/log`, and `rpcbind` in particular reports even a fatal
startup failure only over syslog, so without it a dead daemon leaves no trace in
`docker logs`.

HTTP, SNMP, and IPMI are served for probes that are still stubs, so there is
something to develop against. Wake-on-LAN, ONVIF, Docker, and libvirt get no
service: none of them has a server worth running in a container.

## Configuration

Defaults, overridable with `-e` on `docker run`:

| Variable         | Default                                          | Used by                        |

| `VNC_PORT`       | `5900`                                           | VNC listen port                |
| `RDP_PORT`       | `3389`                                           | RDP listen port                |
| `SSH_PORT`       | `22`                                             | SSH listen port                |
| `HTTP_PORT`      | `80`                                             | HTTP listen port               |
| `SMB_PORT`       | `445`                                            | SMB listen port                |
| `RTSP_PORT`      | `554`                                            | RTSP listen port               |
| `SNMP_PORT`      | `161`                                            | SNMP listen port (udp)         |
| `IPMI_PORT`      | `623`                                            | IPMI listen port (udp)         |
| `NFS_PORT`       | `2049`                                           | NFS listen port                |
| `MOUNT_PORT`     | `2050`                                           | NFS mount service port         |
| `NUT_PORT`       | `3493`                                           | NUT listen port                |

A port set explicitly is left alone by the unprivileged-port fallback above.

`SERVICES` takes a space-separated subset, so a single probe can be worked on
without the rest: `-e SERVICES="nfs smb"`.

`freerdp-shadow-cli` mirrors the desktop without enforcing an account, so the RDP
username and password are only what the probe sends — any values work.

Both filesystem protocols export the same seeded tree, whose contents the manual
checks below assume:

```
/top.txt              "top level"
/docs/readme.txt      "hello probe"
/docs/empty.txt       (empty)
/docs/nested/deep.txt "deep"
```

## Verify from the host

```shell
rpcinfo -p 127.0.0.1                                        # portmapper + NFS/mount
showmount -e 127.0.0.1                                      # exports

```

## Point a probe at it

Probe devices are still hand-authored in the realm `.ron` (the register dialog
has no fields for them). Add these to the `probe.devices` list of your
`*.realm.ron`, assuming the server runs on the same host as the container:

```ron
probe: (
    devices: [
        // VNC-only device (the desktop panel prefers VNC when both are present).
        (
            name: "test-probe (VNC)",
            ip: "127.0.0.1",
            rtsp: None, wol: None, ssh: None, rdp: None,
            vnc: ( host: "127.0.0.1", port: 5900, password: "password" ),
            http: None, ipmi: None, snmp: None, onvif: None,
            docker: None, libvirt: None, ups: None, nfs: None, smb: None,
        ),
        // RDP-only device, so the panel exercises the RDP path.
        (
            name: "test-probe (RDP)",
            ip: "127.0.0.1",
            rtsp: None, wol: None, ssh: None,
            rdp: ( host: "127.0.0.1", port: 3389, username: "probe", password: "password", domain: None ),
            vnc: None,
            http: None, ipmi: None, snmp: None, onvif: None,
            docker: None, libvirt: None, ups: None, nfs: None, smb: None,
        ),
        // Everything else, on one device.
        (
            name: "test-probe",
            ip: "127.0.0.1",
            rtsp: ( port: 554, path: "stream1", username: None, password: None, transport: None ),
            wol: None,
            ssh: ( host: "127.0.0.1", port: 22, username: "probe", password: "password", private_key_path: None, fingerprint: None ),
            rdp: None, vnc: None,
            http: None, ipmi: None, snmp: None, onvif: None, docker: None, libvirt: None,
            ups: ( host: "127.0.0.1", port: 3493, ups_name: "test", username: "probe", password: "password" ),
            nfs: ( export: "/srv/nfs", portmapper_port: None, mount_port: 2050, nfs_port: 2049, uid: 0, gid: 0, privileged_port: false ),
            smb: ( share: "media", port: 445, username: "probe", password: "password", domain: "WORKGROUP" ),
        ),
    ],
),
```

Then start a server + client and open the layer that drives each protocol:
**Desktop** for VNC/RDP (expanding a probe node opens its stream), **Filesystem**
for NFS/SMB, **Shell** for SSH, and the **Probe** layer to see which protocols
each device advertises.
