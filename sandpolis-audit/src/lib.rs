//! The audit subsystem watches host activity logs for noteworthy events.
//!
//! On Linux agents, a continuous background service tails the auditd log,
//! runs every record through the detection rules in [`rules`], stores the
//! matches as [`AuditEventData`] rows, and raises a notification for the
//! serious ones. The rows replicate to the owning server like any other
//! instance-scoped data, so nothing here needs a protocol of its own.
