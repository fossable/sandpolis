//! GUI components for the Desktop layer.
//!
//! Provides the desktop-viewer node panel and the layer's client plugin.
//!
//! The panel wires the full client-side stream pipeline. As soon as it expands
//! it opens a relayed stream to the agent with [`sandpolis_client::sync`]'s
//! websocket connection (`open_stream_to`): the server routes requests to the
//! target agent and responses back. [`DesktopStreamRequester`] decodes incoming
//! frames into RGBA8, a Bevy system drains them and uploads them to the display
//! node's texture, and pointer / keyboard input over that node is mapped into
//! [`DesktopStreamInputEvent`]s and forwarded over the stream's outbound channel.
