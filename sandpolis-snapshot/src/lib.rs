//! Cold snapshots: block-by-block partition images stored on the server.
//!
//! ## Create
//!
//! The server opens a [`streams::SnapshotCreateStream`] toward the agent. The
//! agent reads the partition sequentially, hashing every block and streaming
//! the hashes up in batches. The server compares each batch against the
//! reconstructed previous snapshot (or an all-zero image when this is the
//! first) and replies with the offsets whose blocks it needs; the agent uploads
//! those blocks zstd-compressed. When the whole partition has been scanned and
//! every requested block received, the server commits the staged image as a new
//! qcow2 layer.
//!
//! ## Apply
//!
//! The same exchange in reverse: the agent hashes and streams its current
//! blocks, and the server replies with the blocks that differ from the chosen
//! snapshot, which the agent writes back to the partition.
//!
//! Snapshot content never enters the realm database; the models here are
//! metadata only. The qcow2 layers live under the server's `--data` directory.
