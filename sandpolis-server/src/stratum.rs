//! The local stratum server's link to its global stratum server.
//!
//! A local stratum (LS) server owns the instances attached to it and replicates
//! everything else:
//!
//! - **Estate data** (users, accounts, realms) replicates down: the LS holds a
//!   standing subscription to the GS for global-scope models.
//! - **Ownership** is claimed up. The LS announces its attached instances over
//!   the claim stream (see [`crate::ownership`]); grants come back, each scope
//!   is hydrated from the GS, and from then on the LS applies those agents'
//!   records to its own database — the GS pulls them back up.
//! - **Routing** works in both directions. The LS advertises its attached
//!   instances so the GS can reach them, and points its own default route at the
//!   GS so it can reach everything else.
