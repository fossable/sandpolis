//! Per-instance data ownership across strata.
//!
//! Exactly one server owns a given instance's data at a time: the server that
//! instance is directly connected to. Writes happen at the owner and replicate
//! to the global stratum (GS) server, which holds the whole estate but owns
//! only the instances attached to it directly.
//!
//! The GS is the single arbiter. Servers *claim* the set of instances attached
//! to them — the GS claims locally, a local stratum (LS) server claims over an
//! [`Ownership`] stream on its upstream link — and the GS resolves every claim
//! against one persistent grant table, bumping a fencing epoch each time
//! ownership moves. Disconnecting is not a release: an LS keeps ownership (and
//! keeps writing) through a GS outage, and only loses an instance when it shows
//! up attached somewhere else.
//!
//! Replication follows ownership, always pull-based: the owner serves, the
//! replica subscribes. The GS pulls each LS's owned scopes (plus the LS's own
//! data); an owner pulls its attached agents' records and applies them locally.
//! Because the GS only ever pulls an instance's records from that instance's
//! current owner, a stale owner's writes can never enter the estate — the pull
//! subscription is the fence.
//!
//! A grant is not writable immediately: the new owner first *hydrates* the
//! scope from the GS (a snapshot-complete-bounded subscription), so its
//! revision counters continue where the previous owner left off.
