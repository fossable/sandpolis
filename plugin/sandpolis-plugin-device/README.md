## Sandpolis Device Plugin

_This plugin module is a part of
[Sandpolis](https://github.com/sandpolis/sandpolis)._

The device plugin integrates with various non-Sandpolis devices on the network.
These devices (called subagents) do not run an agent instance, instead
connecting to agent instances via well-known protocols like SSH or HTTP.
